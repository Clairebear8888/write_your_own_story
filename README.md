## ⚙️ Getting Started

Clone the Repository
Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in /backend:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

## 🧠 How It Works

You write your daily entry by answering guided prompts (e.g., “How am I feeling today?”).

The app sends your responses securely to the backend.

The AI model generates a personalized reflection, written in a calm, empathetic tone.

You receive your Echo — a mirror of emotional insight and understanding.

💬 Example

User Entry:

“I felt overwhelmed today because of work, but I managed to take a walk and feel a bit better.”

AI Reflection (Echo):

“It sounds like you carried a lot of pressure today, yet you still found a way to care for yourself by taking that walk. That shows real self-awareness and balance. Small steps like these build lasting resilience.”
